## Known Bugs
- The machine learning occasionally glitches out and gives an extremely unrelated result. Easiest way to fix is by refreshing the page. 
- When selling shares from the portfolio, entering lowercase values will bug it out and remove random amounts. 
- When the portfolio is empty, there is blank space rather than a blank pie chart.
